LearnHub lets you explore what you want to learn. Everyone has some strong concepts in
different subjects like I like to cook and I can make delicious pizza, so I share the video on this
app with notes(optional) OR I have strong knowledge of pointers in C Language, so I share the
video with my understanding and my concept on this app with code snippet.<br/>
So this app contains different categories like cooking, computer programming, health tips, tips
and tricks for medical students etc.<br/>
The another feature of this app user can upload maximum 10 minutes of video. So learner can
learn fast with good focus.<br/>
This app lets you upload your video with important notes or files, but this is optional.
